# MyFlix

A library management and video player desktop application for local TV shows and film video files. 

MyFlix automatically parses filenames to extract the title, and release year, and uses API lookups to retrieve posters and descriptions. 

Made in C# and WPF, using the TMDB API for media metadata lookups.
